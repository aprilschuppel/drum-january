                Drum January is an annual daily drumming challenge by April Schuppel. In years past, April has just performed a full drum cover or original groove each day.
                <br />
                <br />For 2025, Drum January has evolved to a daily guessing game. Each day, she plays a beat and gives people 24 hours to guess what song it&apos;s from. The following day, the previous day&apos;s song is revealed and a new beat is posted.
                <br />
                <br />To play along, follow April on Instagram at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/schupsss/">@schupsss</a> or YouTube at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@aprilschuppel">@aprilschuppel</a>.
